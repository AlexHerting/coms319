    <h3>View 2</h3>
    <p>The catalog of products that the user can choose from. We will have multiple categories of products to choose from. We will have a fuctional search bar as well as a functioning add to cart button. </p> <br>
    <h3>View 3</h3>
    <p>When you click on a product name, the product will take up your screen so that you can see the description. You will be able to press a button to add to cart or return to shopping</p> <br>

    <h1>Final Project description</h1> <br>
    <p>
        The idea for the final project is a very advanced version of the midterm project. 
        With the skills we have learned since the midterm project we will be able to heavily 
        advance the website and its complexity. Our objectives are to make a well structured online store that is 100% 
        functional and would be able to be used at a commercial level. 
    </p> <br>

    <h1>Views</h1> <br>
    <img src="flowchart.PNG">
    <p>The first view will be the welcome screen, it will say something along the lines of "welcome to our online store" with a button to click to eanter the store.</p> <br>
    <p>The button that is pressed will take you straight to the browser view where you will be able to see every single product. There will be a way to sort the products as well as add them to the cart or view them individually.</p> <br>
    <p>When you click on a prodcut, that product will be put in focus and a description of the product will be brought up.</p> <br>
    <p>When you click the "check out" button you will be taken to the cart where you will be able to see all  of your products and the prices</p><br>
    <p>Next the user will be at the confirmation of payment screen where they will be required to put in their payment information to pay for their items. If the cart is empty then this screen will not be available for obvious reasons.</p><br>
    <p>After the user has checked out and payed, they will be prompted to leave a review on any of the items that they purchased.</p><br>
    
    <h1>Internally, there exist JSON files, Javascript files, HTML, CSS, etc.</h1> <br>
    <p>Our plan is to have JSON files that contain a list of products and for our app to be created in react. So we will have a JS file as well as a CSS file for the styling of our work.
        We also plan to include images in an image folder so that our products can be correctly displayed.
    </p> <br>

    <h1>Data</h1> <br>
    <p>So for the products, that will all be rendered from a JSON file. Next when the user is choosing what to put in their cart we can create a gloabal useState variable that can hold all of the items that the user adds to their cart.
        We will Get all of the information of the items added from the JSON file and render them properly in the cart.
        It will be easy to tranfer between pages because we will be using a react template, so it will all be in 1 JS file.
    </p> <br>
