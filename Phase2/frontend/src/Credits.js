        <p>This is phase 2 of the final project. We use get, put, delete, and post methods in the backend to make this project function <br></br> We have also decided to use mongo db as we are much more familiar and comfortable with using it. <br></br>You will notice that we have some unused displays, these are for the final project and were not necesarry for this phase.
