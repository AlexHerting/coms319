        <p>This is Phase 2 of the final project. We use GET, PUT, DELETE, and POST methods in the backend to allow basic roundtrip functionality on our website.<br></br> 
        We have also decided to use MongoDB as our database as we are much more familiar and comfortable with using it. <br></br>
        You will notice that we have some unused displays, these are for the final project and were not necesarry for this phase.
