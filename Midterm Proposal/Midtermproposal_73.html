    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        The initial motivation of this project was when we were demonstrated samples of the project by the professor during the first few lectures in class.
        We then decided that we should create a commerce website regarding PC parts and peripherals because it tends to be a set of products that we both have understanding on and seemed interested to create a website based on the idea.
        Furthermore, Class Activity 05 and Assignment 1 both gave us a hands-on experience on creating and modifying parts of the website, which supports our vision on what the midterm project website might look like.

<section id="obj">
    <h1>Objectives</h1>
    <p>
        Our goal is to create a fully functioning online commerce website that has a cart, reviews, and multiple categories of electronic products.<br>
        We want to have a fully functioning website so that a user can walk through the entire shopping and check-out process, similar to a real website (but not actually recieve or give money). <br>
        Our products will likely have something to do with PC parts and accessories such as: mice, keyboards, headsets, controllers, microphones, GPU's, CPU's, etc. <br>
        Our website will be ideally fully interactive and fully functioning by the time it is done while having a professional look to it.<br>
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin: 5px 0px;">Web pages that we plan to have:</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Home page:</strong> Has an overview of the website that includes a standard header, footer, and sections of products to interest the user. It also has a navigation bar that allows the user to visit 
        the different categories of products, has an option to view cart, has a search bar, and an option to view who we are and what our online store is about.<br>
        <strong>Product pages:</strong> We will have multiple different pages for our products, organized by category. We will have the item price, product name and description, review rating, and an option to add it to your cart. <br>
        <strong>Contact page:</strong> will have all of our information and a way to get in contact with us, as well as a location for our store (which will be ISU, as a placeholder location). <br>
        <strong>Cart page:</strong> You will be able to see all of the items that you added to you cart as well as the prices and the final price of your cart.

<section id="organize">
    <h1>How we will organize the work</h1>
    <p>
        We are using a Git repository on GitHub to share our work with each other and communicate with each other via Discord about ideas we have and what work each person will do.
        We will tell the other person what we plan on doing and ask them for feedback on it before we start working. Whenever we go to work on our project we will communicate 
        that we are working on it, then we will tell each other when we are finished working and what has been done as well as what still needs to be done.
