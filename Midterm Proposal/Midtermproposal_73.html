<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    Our goal is to create a fully functioning online website that has a cart, reviews, and multiple categories of products.<br>
    We want to have a fully functioning option so that a user can check out (but not actually recieve or give money) <br>
    Our products will likely have to do something with PC parts and accessories such as: mice, keyboards, headsets, controllers, microphones, gpu's, cpu's, etc... <br>
    Our website will be ideally fully interactive and fully functioning by the time it is done while having a professional look to it <br>
</p>

<h1>How we will organize the work</h1>
<p>
    We are using a git repository to share our work with eachother, we communicate with eachother via discord about ideas we have and what work each person will do.
    We will tell the other person what we plan on doing and ask them for feedback on it before we start working. Whenever we go to work on our project we will communicate 
    that we are working on it, then we will tell eachother when we are finished working and what has been done as well as what still needs to be done.
